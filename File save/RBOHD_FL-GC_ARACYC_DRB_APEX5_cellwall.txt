Hypothetical models for the origin of chronic hypoxia in plant cell niches. A generic structured cell mass is depicted and coloured in shades of blue to indicate relative respiratory activity. (a) High respiratory activity of the central‐localised cells could drive hypoxia. (b) Oxygen consumption by the outer niche cells limits oxygen diffusion to the niche core. (c) A physical barrier to oxygen diffusion promotes the establishment of hypoxia in the entire niche. Proposed metabolic pathways in the different regions of the niche are indicated at the bottom of the figure: oxidative phosphorylation via the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor (left) or glycolytic production of ATP sustained by NAD + regeneration via fermentation (right).

SRG3 &

NAC12
Encodes a member of the NAC family of transcription factors. ANAC102 appears to have a role in mediating response to low oxygen stress (hypoxia) in germinating seedlings. Its expression can be induced by beta-cyclocitral, an oxidized by-product of beta-carotene generated in the chloroplasts, mediates a protective retrograde response that lowers the levels of toxic peroxides and carbonyls, limiting damage to intracellular components.

Purple lines link the same gene that are shared by multiple gene lists.
Blue lines link the different genes where they fall into the same ontology term (the term has to statistically significantly enriched and with size no larger than 100).
The greater the number of purple links and the longer the dark orange arcs implies greater overlap among the input gene lists.  Blue links indicate the amount of functional overlap among the input gene lists.  It is common in meta-analysis that we observe little directly overlap among studies, due to the variations in the biological assays used, however, we tend to see a lot more functional overlap, as these studies probably captured different parts of the same biological processes.
The Circos plot shows how genes from the input gene lists overlap.
On the outside, each arc represents the identity of each gene list, using the same color code as the color used for table rows in slide #2.
On the inside, each arc represent a gene list, where each gene has a spot on the arc.  Dark orange color represents the genes that appear in multiple lists and light orange color represents genes that are unique to that gene list.
Purple lines link the same gene that are shared by multiple gene lists.
The greater the number of purple links and the longer the dark orange arcs implies greater overlap among the input gene lists.

RNOH D keeps the products of glycolysis flowing while WT suppresses this pathway.
RBOH promotes Lipoamide-R pathway while WT suppresses it. 
RBOH promotes the creation of Citrate while WT down regulates it . 
The only part of the TCA cycle suppressed in ROBH is the convertion of Oxalacetate to phosphoenol pyruvate.

The Artist said "I was originally given the idea for this drawing in an AstroBotany Class, but my love for space and steampunk helped fuel my imagination. As an artist I have learned that ideas are hard to come by, so coming across the science about colonizing the moon and Mars helped me generate a story.” 

“The Story is about two siblings wanting more than just life on Earth. They go from the earth to the moon then fly on to Mars. This drawing was overall fun and I would do it again of I could another idea for an adventure story"

Posttranscriptional Induction of Two Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase Genes in Arabidopsis Is Mediated by Downregulation of miR398 and Important for Oxidative Stress Tolerance
(2006) The Plant Cell 18(8):2051-65
DOI: 10.1105/tpc.106.041673
miR398 targets two closely related Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (cytosolic CSD1 and chloroplastic CSD2) that can detoxify superoxide radicals. CSD1 and CSD2 transcripts are induced in response to oxidative stress

True for Rice 
miR398 regulation in rice of the responses to abiotic and biotic stresses depends on CSD1 and CSD2 expression

Abstract Title: 
Conserved plant transcriptional responses to microgravity from two consecutive spaceflight experiments. 

Presenter: 
Imara Y Perera 

In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1g and micro g shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b and miR8683) that were up regulated in microgravity
